# URL-Shorten-Service
This HTML code defines a simple web page for a URL shortener service. It includes an input field where users can enter a URL, two buttons to encode and decode the URL, and a span element to display the encoded or decoded URL.

This code also includes a reference to an external JavaScript file named "URLShortenerService.js". Make sure to create this file and define the functions encodeURL() and decodeURL() in it to handle URL encoding and decoding.
